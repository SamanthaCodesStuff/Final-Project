    <h2>Computer Descriptions and Comparisons</h2>
    <p>These two computers are very similar but still have their differences. 
        Such differences are, one computer is a custom, meaning that it has more of my preferences
         but is subject to incompatibilities and problems whereas the other computer is made by
         professionals and may not be everything I want but will have minimal mistakes and problems. 
         I still consider them to be both very good because they have all the hardware and features to 
         allow me to do everything that I want to do. Something that is a huge difference between the 
         computer is their hard drives, with the first computer, you have 800 GB of space, but it is 
         $255.35, and the second computer has 512 GB but is only $59! This price difference is very 
         important if you are on a budget and do not plan on using a lot of computer apps it very good and 
         probably what you should choose instead of the custom computer.</p>

    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p>In both computers, there is no software that comes with them (unless you want to count the operating system) 
        so I will be installing everything else by myself.</p>

    <p>I chose Microsoft 365 because with it I can easily do all my schoolwork with no problem and 
        while I will have to pay for it, it is absolutely worth it because of the plethora of features 
        I can use and how a lot of jobs in the future require you to use it for writing and making projects. 
        I want to get VS and VSC because they are my favourite IDE and source editor respectively and because 
        they are made and maintained by Microsoft, I can trust that I will be able to use them for a long time 
        and that all my code will be safe when using them. I use OPERA GX because I usually have browser open 
        while I play video games and I don’t want the browser to take a lot of RAMS even if I have a lot of it, 
        hence why I chose OPERA GX which is made to not take a lot of computer resources. I chose Zoom and Teams 
        because a lot of jobs and people use them so it would be very useful to already have them installed. 
        The reason why I listed Games as free is because none of the games I play currently are free to play and 
        I don’t plan on buying any computer games. Lastly, I chose Adobe Creative Cloud because I like to draw using my 
        drawing tablet is photoshop is good for that and I use Premiere Pro a lot in my free time so it would be very useful to me.</p>
