        All in all, I find that the best parts of both computers are their ability to run applications 
        well and efficiently and to be able to handle a lot of things going on at once without crashing or 
        freezing. I would use the machine to work on coding projects, meeting with other people, occasionally 
        play games and work on school projects and homework. The second computer is very good because it is 
        still very good and cheaper and still allows me to a lot of the things I want to do when using a personal 
        computer but still, in my opinion, the prebuilt may be good for the first computer you buy but I still think 
        that the custom computer is better because its hardware is better and while more expensive it is still worth it.
        According to Intel “DIY and custom-built PCs <b>allow far more hardware configuration options</b>than a pre-built PC. 
        Some custom gaming PC builders provide the option for a professional to customize the look of your build. While there
        is no “cheapest” option, cost-cutting strategies can save you money on pre-built, custom-built, and DIY PCs.” Once again,
        I would absolutely choose the custom computer because I can do everything, I want to do with it like running a source editor 
        (VSC – my favourite) and to play my favourite games with no problems. It also has a lot of space so I can install all these apps 
        as a lot of them take a lot of space. It is also able to run apps like Premiere Pro very well so that is another very good feature 
        of it. The custom computer is very good, and I am happy with all its features and components.
