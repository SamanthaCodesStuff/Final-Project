    <h2>Analysis of Computer Needs</h2>
    <p>I want to be able to use this computer to be able to run games with at least 150 fps 
        and be able to install around 15-20 games without me having to uninstall one all the time. 
        I also want to be able to run around three to four apps at the same time without the computer 
        slowing down. Ex: running Minecraft, Opera Gx, Discord (in the background).
        I do not want the computer to overheat or crash unexpectedly and to be quiet and not very loud. 
        Some other needs that I want to the computer to be able to do are, to be able to run word and other 
        office apps efficiently so that I can get work done fast and be able to collaborate with other people. 
        I also want it to run Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code and use all their features with no problem. 
        I am also going to use the computer to do other everyday things like watching YouTube videos or Netflix, 
        and also use it to learn like with using Duolingo to continue learning Japanese and Quizlet/Kahoot. 
        Another reason why I want low input lag is because a lot of games I play such as StarCraft 2 and apps I 
        use like csTimer for checking my cubing times require me to click multiple times or to press buttons very 
        quickly to get optimal times (csTimer/Rubik’s cube) or to actually win against my opponent (StarCraft 2 ).</p>
